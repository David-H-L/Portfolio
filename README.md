# Personal portfolio

My portfolio ðŸš€

## Description

This is my personal portfolio. Finally, after some days of work, I finished it!
I learned new technologies along the way and discovered new methods to create even better projects.
Iâ€™m very happy to have completed my own portfolio on this date **12-10-2025, at 6:20 PM.**
Now, I still have a lot to learn and many things to improve.

**Note: The portfolio is dynamic and changes with the holidays throughout the year, such as Halloween and Christmas.**
